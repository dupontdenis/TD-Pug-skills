# Project Title

This project generates an `index.html` file from a list of skills stored in a `skills.json` file.

## Getting Started

```
node app.mjs
```

This command will read the skills.json file and generate an index.html file in the project root directory.

Open the index.html file in your browser to view the list of skills.

## Running the project with Live Server

If you have Live Server installed, you can use it to serve the index.html file. This will automatically refresh the page whenever you regenerate the index.html file.

To start Live Server, right-click on the index.html file in your editor and select "Open with Live Server".
